Things to test:

change histories points
get it to map percentage change somehow
use correlated stocks
try training on several stocks then use same model to predict each. i.e. concatenate their values together?
determine if there is a relationship between predicted value and the likelihood of going up/down
	i.e. is a large predicted rise more likely to be a rise (small or big) than a small prediction?
	
fine-tune trading threshold 

why does it do poorly on cheaper stocks?

play with different chunks of time in the stock

use other technical indicators as well

play with trading also, how/when to buy/sell
